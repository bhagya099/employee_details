# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Create a project to see All Employees-details by serach their skill name (Skill what they have).

## Task 

1. Serach all the Employees details by their skills.
2. On search result Employee details will  give result with their Manager name and all the details of Manager.

## Langauge what I used -
1. React Js 
2. Css (To make page layout)


## How does it go. 

1. I created a JSON Data(mock) for employyes and manager.
2. I connected Employee and Manager with the id(like in Employee id 1 reprting manager will id with number 22).
3. After displaing the result I use a button to see Manager details.
4. I used "onchange" state (React hook) to getting results.  


## In future
1. I want to add Manager's Manager details and will show the details of Manager in between search bar and Employee details result (not as a pop up window).
2. Will add a "FORM" to add new Employee details.
3. To make it editable Employee skill(or want to add more skill). But only login in Employee can edit his/her details (skill).






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
